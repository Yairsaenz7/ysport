# Yair Saenz Portfolio

I made this portfolio with Angular 8 and Google Firestore.<br/><br/>

Steps:<br/>
git clone https://github.com/Yairsaenz7/ysport <br/>
cd ysport<br/>
set your firestore config variables in the environment.ts<br/>
add 'works' collection in Firestore. Each work in works should have name, desc, image and order<br/>
npm i <br/>
ng serve<br/><br/>

go to http://localhost:4200
