# Yair Saenz Portfolio

I made this portfolio with Angular 8 and Google Firestore.

Steps:
git clone https://github.com/Yairsaenz7/ysport
cd ysport
set your firestore config variables in the environment.ts
add 'works' collection in Firestore. Each work in works should have name, desc, image and order
npm i 
ng serve
